description: Best remembered for penning the screenplay for the classic film King
  Kong, author Edgar Wallace was an astoundingly popular luminary in the action-adventure
  genre in the early twentieth century. The Book of All-Power is a story packed with
  intrigue, treachery, assassinations, and machinations, and it highlights Wallace's
  unmatched skill in setting a pulse-pounding pace.
